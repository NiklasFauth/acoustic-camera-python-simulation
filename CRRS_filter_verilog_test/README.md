CRRS filter implemented in verilog as suggested in this paper:
https://sci-hub.tw/https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6882370/

Should be placed inside the examples path (cocotb/examples/) of a working cocotb installation. Type "make" in filter/tests/ to plot filter response to a typical PDM signal.
